                    <h3>With Artura, we started with a clean sheet. The McLaren Carbon Fibre Lightweight Architecture (MCLA) at its core is all-new. As is the High-Performance Hybrid powertrain. And so much more.

                        Our relentless pursuit of lightness reaches another level. Aerodynamic efficiency is more advanced than ever. Helping to shape a minimal, beautiful new design.
                        
                        From the rear suspension to the advanced E-differential, every new element contributes to a uniquely intense driving experience.
                        
                        Ultra-light engineering. Blistering electrified power. Sublime agility and engagement. McLaren to the core. For the next generation.</h3>

                    <h3>At McLaren, we do not fear the unknown. We do not fear the challenge. The new McLaren 765LT has a legend to live up to: Longtail. Every car that’s carried this name has been unique. Extreme and utterly focused around the driver. All about maximum engagement. Searing performance. Sensational handling.
                        Being based on the incredible 720S, the latest LT has everything in its favour. A flying start. And it delivers on every level. Radically lightened and lower, the 765LT uses innovative aerodynamics to create 25% more downforce than the 720S.

And this is the most powerful LT yet, with a shattering 765PS. Just 765 will ever be produced. For the lucky few, the next chapter is beginning…
Introducing the new 765LT. Born from fearless engineering.
                    </h3>
